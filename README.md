**( ii )** Dynamically parameterized Intra-Stock Mamba Selection Layer introduces specialized financial inductive biases with time-series linear complexity<br>
**( iii )** Stock-wise Tokenization Layer converts temporal tokens into stock tokens preserving sequence integrity, and Inter-Stock Attention Layer captures market correlations via attention between stock tokens while reducing complexity from temporal sequence ( $O(T^2)$ ) to stock quantity ( $O(N^2)$ ) where $N \ll T$.<br>
**Future Work:** Exploring the derivation of manifold geometry to approximate optimal transport for aligning sentiment data and stock data, with the aim of generalizing to multi-modal time series alignment.<br>

⚡ (I) Project 1: Led a Provincial-level Undergraduate Entrepreneurial Practice Project — ```Wuxian Technology — Leader in Automotive 4D Imaging Millimeter-Wave Radar Antennas``` (March 2024 - Present).<br>
**Responsibilities:** As the primary project lead, I managed the team and coordinated the project's application, execution, and conclusion. I was also primarily responsible for developing the team's MIMO-based FMCW radar algorithms.<br>
**Achievements:** As the second person-in-charge, the project secured Silver Awards in both the Hubei Provincial China International College Students' 'Internet+' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition and the Hubei Provincial iCAN Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.

### III. Future Plans
🌱 I plan to delve deeply into the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence during my doctoral studies. Given the current trend of high interdisciplinary integration among AI branches, I aim to maintain an open mind to actively learn and explore various directions, including but not limited to Machine Learning Theory, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Large Model Alignment or Lightweighting, Embodied Intelligence, and Large Model Safety. I aim to identify a specific research topic that ignites my passion.<br>
🌱 My current research interests are particularly focused on directions built upon a solid foundation of theoretical derivation, can be closely integrated with deep learning models, and ultimately have clear vertical application scenarios. I aspire to explore the fundamental principles of intelligent behavior through rigorous mathematical modeling and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, I am committed to applying these theoretical insights to enhance existing deep learning algorithms' performance, interpretability, or generalization capabilities. For instance, my current exploration involves leveraging manifold geometry to approximate optimal transport for multi-modal time series alignment. Through this, I hope to uncover the intrinsic nature of how neural networks learn distributions and topological structures, and even investigate whether this approach can address the "shallow alignment" problem in large model safety, as well as how to discover multiple research problems and develop various models stemming from optimal transport theory.
